## Release Notes

<!-- In an effort to automate the generation of release notes, each PR has a "release-ready" explanation of the change. Everything after this comment will be added to our initial set of auto-generated notes (don't worry, we'll proof read them first before shipping). If you are an external contributor, feel free to skip this section; we'll come by to add in some release notes later. If you want to give it a go, check out our previous release notes for some examples of our style: https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/releases -->
